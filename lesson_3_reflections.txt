When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

	to share your work with others or other developers who may be interested in contributing


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	the remote repository is just a peer in a distributed network that other people are pushing to so because my master is linked to my current local branch an automatic push/pull would force changes into my code branch that i might not want or anticipate
